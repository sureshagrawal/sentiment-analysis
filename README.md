# Sentiment Analysis – AI Web Application

A production-ready **AI-powered Sentiment Analysis system** built with a clean, modular architecture.

The project focuses on:
- Machine Learning correctness
- Clean API design
- Premium frontend UX
- Deployment-readiness

Future platform extensions (mobile apps, etc.) will reuse the same core system without duplicating logic.

---

## 🧠 What This Project Does

- Analyzes text and predicts sentiment:
  - Positive
  - Negative
  - Neutral
- Returns a confidence score based on model probability
- Visualizes confidence in a premium, animated UI
